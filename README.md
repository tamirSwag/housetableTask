# housetableTask

Welcome to Tamir's housetable task :)

In order to run the application you are required to run the api and the client.
Open two terminals in the git repo root directory, in one run "npm run start-api" and in the other run "npm run start-client".
Wait a minute and the browser will open with the client ready to use.

Enjoy testing!

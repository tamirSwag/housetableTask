# housetableTask

Welcome to Tamir's housetable task :)

## How to run the application
In order to run the application you are required to run the api and the client.
To do that, open two terminals in the git repo root directory, in one run the command ```"npm run start-api"``` and in the other run ```"npm run start-client"```.
Wait a minute and the browser will open with the client ready to use.

Enjoy testing!
